This vignette provides detailed documentation and usage examples for generating QC summary documents with the **review** package. The functions, `renderQCSummary()` and `renderQCReport()`, generate documents containing QC summary tables. These are intended to aid in quality control and prioritizing QC resourcing.

## Table of Contents

- **`renderQCSummary()`**: Generates a document with summary tables of outstanding QC information
- **`renderQCReport()`**: Generates a document that provides the QC status of files in a project

---

## `renderQCSummary()`

The `renderQCSummary()` function generates a QC summary based on scripts within a given project and renders it into a PDF report. This PDF contains multiple summaries, including:

- Files with outstanding QC that have been added to the `QClog.csv` file.
- Recently modified files that have not been added to the `QClog.csv` file.

### Usage

To generate a QC Summary report, use the following command:

```r
renderQCSummary()
```

#### Outstanding QC Summary

When files require QC, the following type of table will appear in the report:

**Output (Example):**

| File                   | Last Author     | Previous QCers           |
|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| script/data-assembly.R | Jane Doe        | none                     |
| script/examp-txt.txt   | John Smith      | Alice Johnson            |
| script/pk/load-spec.R  | John Smith      | Jane Doe, Alice Johnson  |

Each file that appears in this table requires QC. The column **Previous QCers** lists reviewers who previously QC'd the file.

#### Recently Modified Files Summary

Another section of the report identifies recently modified files not in the QC log:

**Output (Example):**

| File                     | Last Author   | Days Since Last Edit     |
|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| script/eda-tables.R      | Jane Doe      | 1                        |
| script/eda-figures.R     | Alice Johnson | 8                        |
| script/pk/check-sum.yaml | Alice Johnson | 20                       |

This summary helps prioritize adding files to the QC log.

## `renderQCReport()`

The `renderQCReport()` function generates a comprehensive QC status summary of all files in the QC log and renders it into a PDF report. This report provides an overview of files that are up-to-date or still require QC.

### Usage

To generate a QC Report, use the following command:

```r
renderQCReport()
```

#### Output (Example):

**Table:**

| File                     | QCed Revision | Last Revision | Status     | QC Date       |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| script/data-assembly.R   | 3             | 3             | QCed       | 2025-01-15    |
| script/examp-txt.txt     | 2             | 3             | Needs QC   |               |
| script/pk/load-spec.R    | 4             | 5             | Needs QC   |               |

The table highlights:

- Files that are **up-to-date with QC**.
- Files that **need QC**.

# Additional Notes

- **Saving documents**: Users can specify a directory for saving reports using the `.output_dir` parameter.
- **Customization**: Adjustments to project parameters or templates (`QCSummary.Rmd`, `QCReport.Rmd`) allow tailored outputs for specific needs.
