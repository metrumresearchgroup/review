This vignette provides detailed documentation and usage examples for the three main diff-related functions in the **review** package: `svnLog()`, `diffPreviousRevisions()`, and `diffQced()`. These functions facilitate the visual comparison of different versions of files within your SVN-managed project, aiding in quality control and code review processes.

## Table of Contents

- **svnLog()**: Retrieves revision history for a file  
- **diffPreviousRevisions()**: Compares two revisions of a file  
- **diffQced()**: Compares the latest version with the most recent QCed version  

---

## svnLog()

The `svnLog()` function returns the SVN revision history (revisions, authors, timestamps, and messages) for a specified file. This history is useful for comparing different versions of a file.

### Usage

#### Retrieve Full Revision History

```r
svnLog("script/data-assembly.R")
```

**Output (Example):**

| rev | author         | datetime              | msg                 |
|-----|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 3   | Bob            | 2025-01-15 10:00:00   | Added new feature   |
| 2   | Alice Johnson  | 2025-01-10 09:00:00   | Modified data load  |
| 1   | John Smith     | 2025-01-05 08:30:00   | Initial commit      |

## diffPreviousRevisions()

The `diffPreviousRevisions()` function visually identifies changes between two revisions of a file, highlighting additions, deletions, and modifications.

### Usage

#### Compare with a Specific Previous Revision

```r
diffPreviousRevisions(
  .file = "script/data-assembly.R",
  .previous_revision = 2,
  .side_by_side = FALSE
)
```

![Output of `diffPreviousVersions()`: <span style="background-color: lightgreen;">green text</span> indicates modified code, <span style="background-color: #ffcccc;">red text</span> indicates deleted code.](figures/diff-previous-revisions.png){width=700}

---

## diffQced()

The `diffQced()` function identifies differences between the latest local version of a file and the most recent QCed revision, visually highlighting any changes that may need re-evaluation.

### Usage

#### Compare with the Last QCed Revision

```r
diffQced("script/data-assembly.R")
```

**Output (Illustrative):**

A rendered diff in your Viewer pane, highlighting lines added, removed, or changed since the last QCed revision.

# Additional Notes

- **Customization**: You can customize the display of diffs by adjusting parameters such as `.side_by_side`, `.ignore_white_space`, and `.display_entire_file` as needed.
- **SVN Updates**: Always ensure your working copy is up to date (e.g., `svn up`) before comparing file revisions.
