\title{Builds a comparative HTML document from specified file paths}
\usage{
buildCompare(.dfpaths, .side_by_side, .headings, .open_all = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.dfpaths}{A dataframe with columns \code{compname}, \code{path1}, and \code{path2}
indicating the name of the comparison set and file paths to compare.}

\item{.side_by_side}{Logical; if TRUE, display documents side-by-side,
otherwise allow toggling between documents with radio buttons.}

\item{.headings}{Character. Figure headings.}

\item{.open_all}{Logical. Should all figures be open when the page loads?}
}
\value{
The file path of the generated HTML document. This path is returned
invisibly and will be automatically opened in a browser if the function
is run interactively.
}
\description{
This internal function creates a detailed comparison report in HTML format
from the file paths provided in \code{.dfpaths}. It supports side-by-side
or single view toggling between documents. Currently, it handles TeX files
by converting them into PDFs and embedding them into the report.
}
\details{
The function processes each row in \code{.dfpaths} dataframe and handles
each file according to its extension. For \code{.tex} files, it compiles them to
PDF using an internal helper function \code{tex_to_pdf} which integrates LaTeX
packages and wraps the content into a complete LaTeX document before
compilation.

The function creates a collapsible HTML layout for each comparison set, with
optional side-by-side display of documents, or toggling display via radio
buttons. Additional JavaScript is embedded for toggling visibility of elements.
