}
\description{
Create a SVN repo with files checked in and a QC log. The purpose of this
demo repo is for the user to become familiar with using review functions.

The files checked into the repo are at various stages in terms of their QC
needs. This function returns the path to the repo, so that the user can set
their working directory to it.

This demo repo is created in the \code{tmp} folder, so a new one will need to be
generated whenever the user restarts R.
