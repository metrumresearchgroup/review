}
\arguments{

}
\description{
Generates a comprehensive summary of the revision and quality control (QC) history
for a file. The function reports:
\itemize{
\item QC status (up to date, needs QC, or not assigned)
\item Presence in the QC log
\item Historical information about previous authors
\item Historical information about previous QC reviewers
}
}
\details{
The function prints a formatted summary to the console and invisibly returns
the data for programmatic use. Non-existent files generate warnings and are
skipped. Files not found in the repository history are also skipped.

QC status can be:
\itemize{
\item "QC up to date" - Latest revision has been QC'd
\item "Needs QC" - New changes need review
\item "Not assigned" - File not in QC system
}
}

# Process all files in a directory
purrr::walk(list.files("script/data-assembly", full.names = TRUE), ~ fileSummary(.file = .x))
}
