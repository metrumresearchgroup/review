\title{Summarize revision and QC history for a file or directory}
\usage{
fileSummary(.file)
}
\arguments{
\item{.file}{File or directory path.}
}
\description{
Generates a comprehensive summary of the revision and quality control (QC) history
for a file. The function reports:
\itemize{
\item QC status (up to date, needs QC, or not assigned)
\item Presence in the QC log
\item Historical information about previous authors
\item Historical information about previous QC reviewers
}
}
\details{
The function prints a formatted summary to the console and invisibly returns
the data for programmatic use. If a directory is supplied, each immediate
file in that directory is summarized and a named list of results is returned.
Non-existent files generate warnings and are skipped. Files not found in the
repository history are also skipped.

QC status can be:
\itemize{
\item "QC up to date" - Latest revision has been QC'd
\item "Needs QC" - New changes need review
\item "Not assigned" - File not in QC system
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Analyze a single script file
fileSummary("script/data-assembly/study-101.R")

# Process all files in a directory
fileSummary("script/data-assembly")
}
