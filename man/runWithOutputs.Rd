\description{
Executes an R script in a separate R session using \code{here::here()} as the
working directory. Console output is written to
\verb{data/outputs/<script-path>.log}, where \verb{<script-path>} is the script's path
relative to the project root (without the file extension) with folder levels
separated by \verb{--}. File creation, deletion, and modification events are
recorded in \verb{data/outputs/<script-path>-outputs.csv}. Each CSV row contains
the event type and the affected output path relative to the project root.
